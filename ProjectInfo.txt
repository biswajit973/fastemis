# FastEMIs - Project Information & Handoff Document

## 1. Project Overview & Goal
**FastEMIs** is a B2B2C Point-of-Sale (POS) finance web platform built with Angular 18.
The goal of the project is to provide a seamless, white-labeled experience for retail customers to apply for instant EMIs (loans) while checking out at various partner stores (e.g., Apple, Samsung, Croma). 

The platform supports a full end-to-end flow: browsing partners, viewing partner-specific offerings, applying for a loan (multi-step KYC), and a real-time dashboard to manage the application status (Background Verification, Agreement Signing, Advance Payment, and Disbursal).

## 2. Tech Stack & Architecture
- **Framework:** Angular 18 (Standalone Components strongly preferred over NgModules)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Custom SCSS variables (`src/styles.scss` & `tailwind.config.js`). 
  - *CRITICAL NOTE:* Due to local `npm` cache permission errors (`EPERM`) on the user's machine, we temporarily injected Tailwind CSS via CDN inside `src/index.html`. 
- **State Management:** Angular Signals (`signal<T>`) are entirely preferred over RxJS `BehaviorSubject` for synchronous component state. RxJS is strictly used for HTTP calls and async operations.
- **Mock Backend:** The app runs entirely offline using `src/app/core/interceptors/mock-api.interceptor.ts`. It intercepts `/api/*` calls, fakes a 500ms network delay, and returns mock HTTP responses.
- **Static Assets:** Mock JSON data (like `partners.json` and `tnc-questions.json`) is stored in `public/assets/data/` (In Angular 18, `public/` replaces the old `src/assets/` folder).

## 3. Core Features & Components Built
### Public Pages
- **Navbar:** Sticky navigation with dynamic branding based on the active partner.
- **Home Component (`/`):** Includes Hero, Stats, How It Works, Partner Grid, Trust Signals, and FAQ sections.
- **Location Dialog Modal:** Prompts the user to confirm their location before proceeding to a partner page.

### Partner Detail Page (`/partner/:slug`)
- Dynamic theming (colors apply globally via CSS variables based on the selected partner).
- Displays partner-specific offerings, mocked 4.5+ star reviews, and FAQs.

### Loan Application Flow (`/apply`)
A reactive multi-step wizard:
- Step 1: Personal Information
- Step 2: Address Details
- Step 3: KYC Documents (PAN / Aadhaar validation)
- Step 4: Employment & Loan Details
- Step 5: Account Security (OTP & Password generation)

### User Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
The command center for users post-application:
- **Status Tracker:** A visual stepper showing the journey from Submitted -> Verified -> Disbursed.
- **BGV Card:** Simulates a Background Verification check.
- **Agreement Card:** Prompts the user to sign the Terms & Conditions. Fully full-screen overlay component.
- **Payment Card:** Handles the first advance EMI payment. Features a live Countdown Timer component (expects `string | Date`) and an Upload screenshot zone.
- **Completion Card:** Displays the final loan schedule once disbursed.

### Messaging System (`/dashboard/messages`)
- A WhatsApp-style live chat interface.
- Includes a polling interval simulating external "System" messages (e.g., "Credit bureau match successful!").

## 4. Important Notes & Fixes for Future Agents (READ THIS!)
1. **NPM Installations:** The host machine has severe `EPERM` issues inside `/Users/biswajitpanda/.npm` and `node_modules`. **Do not attempt to run `npm install`** without explicit user permission. It will fail. Stick to coding fixes instead of installing new packages whenever possible.
2. **TypeScript Strictness:** Strict mode is enabled. Be very careful with `null` / `undefined` checks, especially when mapping HTTP responses or reading Angular `signal()` values (e.g., `application()?.status`).
3. **Data Fetching:** 
   - `MockApiInterceptor` intercepts all `/api/` calls.
   - If an API fails (like `/api/partners`), the `PartnerService` gracefully falls back to fetching `public/assets/data/partners.json` directly using `HttpClient`.
   - Ensure you use `HttpClient` directly without `ApiService` for static local JSON files, otherwise the URL will accidentally become `/api/assets/...`.
4. **Angular 18 specific patterns:**
   - Use `@Component({ standalone: true, imports: [...] })` for everything.
   - Use `@Input()`, `@Output()` signals and standard properties.
   - Global styles should define CSS variables (`--primary`, `--surface`) that Tailwind consumes.
